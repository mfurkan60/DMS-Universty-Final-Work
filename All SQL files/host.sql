At the turn of the 20th century, before the great fire in 1906, the house was moved to Glen Park area, to serve (I believe) as a model home in a new area of San Francisco being develeoped by this speculator nameed Joost (the house is on Joost Ave).  Joost came to San Francisco after returning from Panama where he worked (unsuccessfully) to build a canal.  While years later his vision would be realized by others, I admire his boldness. \r\n\r\nI\'d like to share the house with those who will enjoy it and respect its history.  It survived the earthquake and the great fire, so hoping it will survive rentals:)  \r\n\r\nI\'ve now added my Chicago apartment which is an equally spectacular place but with a completely different vibe.

She received her BA in Anthropology from the University of Illinois, Urbana, in 1966 and joined the Peace Corps that same year.  She served as a Volunteer for three years in Ilheus, Bahia, Brazil, where she founded a leather working factory that provided steady work for local shoe makers.  Upon her return she went to Illinois Institute of Technology where she received an MA in Linguistics.\r\nShe tolerated the weather in Chicago until 1973 when she moved to San Francisco where Peace Corps friends facilitated her settlement into a new life on the West Coast.  Two months after she arrived she broke her leg in a ski accident and spent 11 months in a cast.  When able to walk again, she pursued a sign painting business which grew into a brokerage for architectural graphics.  From that she moved into print brokering, specializing in 3-D displays.  This enabled her to buy the house she was living in on Potrero Hill in San Francisco.\r\nThe recession in 1989 plus the introduction of computer technology into the world of print created a crossroad.  AnneKarin decided to give up the printing business and return to graduate school where she earned a graduate certificate in Educational Therapy.

I decided it was time and we headed to Nicaragua for the first time.\r\n\r\nI did not have any set expectations.

You are going to love our recently remodeled and tastefully furnished in true San Francisco\'s Mission style fashion place. Our home boasts a unique charm, with many of the original features and woodwork from its over-a-century-year-old building still in tact.\n\nAbout Us \n\nPete: \nI am a graduate of New York University where I studied economics. I now work in finance and often find myself rock climbing.\n\nIvan: \nI am a recent graduate of the University of California, Berkeley. There I studied economics. I am currently taking a sabbatical before heading to grad school for Divinity. \n\n\nWe absolutely love our home and we hope you will too!\n\n\nGuest Access\n\nYou are welcome to use the kitchen and to keep food in the refrigerator and freezer if needed. We have a drip coffee maker for your use, electric tea kettle, toaster oven, microwave, gas range and oven. \n\nWe provide high-speed wireless internet access at no additional charge. WiFi password should be unlocked w.in Airbnb site, but it can also be found on the fridge. \n\n\nInteraction with Guests\n\nPeter and I have taken a different approach with the way we interact with our guests.  Although we reside in our home, we let our guests roam freely, come in and out of the home as they please.  If any questions or concerns arise, we are just a phone call or text message away. \n\nThe Neighborhood\n\nBoasting some of the best weather in the city, the Mission District takes advantage of an abundance of fog-free days. New restaurants and night spots are a draw while Mission Dolores, 16th and Dolores streets, is the oldest structure in San Francisco. Many of the city’s pioneers are buried in an adjacent cemetery. The largest concentration of murals in the city adorn buildings, fences and walls throughout the district. \n\nEverything is easily accessible: restaurants, museums, waterfront, shopping -- plus so much more this amazing city has to offer. We\'re just a short walk to the Castro, Noe Valley, Bernal Heights, and all the nightlife of SoMa.\n\n With two BART stations, easy access to the rest of the city, wide bike paths and a rich arts and food culture, it’s easy to see why the Mission is appealing to longtime residents and newcomers alike. \n\nSan Francisco has some of the best food in the world, and we\'ve got plenty of places to grab breakfast, lunch or dinner within just a block or two. Let us give you a recommendation to suit your tastes, or explore our local favorites.\n\nGetting Around\n\nWe\'re only minutes walk from Muni, BART, and we\'re easily freeway-accessible if you\'re driving. (Parking is challenging so public transport is the way to go!) Uber and taxis are also an easy option. We have a parking space that is sometimes available- ask if needed. \n\nOther Things to Note\n-Our home is usually pretty quiet, some street noise, but nothing too heavy.   \n\n\n', 'within an hour', '100%', 't', '3', '3', 't', 't', '3', '2411'),
